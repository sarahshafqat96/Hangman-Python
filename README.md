# Introduction
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one tries to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman figure (traditionally a stick figure) is drawn. The game progresses until the word is guessed correctly or the hangman figure is completed, resulting in a loss for the guessing player. The objective is to guess the word or phrase before the drawing is finished. 

# Features
- Random word selection from a pre-defined list
- ASCII art for visual representation of the hangman figure
